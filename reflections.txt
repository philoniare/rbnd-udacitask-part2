# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
An hour and half
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Expanding and adding new features without worries or moving fast thanks to a
strong foundation of making good design decisions early on that makes changes
easier afterwards.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
a) Added command-line I/O class for adding new items and creating new lists
    The current app had manual task entry and users wouldn't want to edit the
    code to add a task. The command-line becomes a simple front-end for that.
b) Allow for the deletion of multiple items
    Gets a command-separated ids for deleting multiple items
c) Created a new item type 'meeting'
    Meetings different from events in quite a few aspects and to adding
    further functionality will be easier when we have separate class for 'meetings'
d) Added a alert class that can be set to generate alerts
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
The user interface could be improved and data could also be persisted.
