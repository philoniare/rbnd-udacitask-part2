# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
2 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Expanding and adding new features without worries or moving fast thanks to a
strong foundation of making good design decisions early on that makes changes
easier afterwards. Learning to build a big system and maintaining was also a
great pleasure. I tried to keep a very close feedback loop when testing out my
code. For example, when testing different menu options, I temporarily created
methods to access the issue directly instead of having to enter values each
time manually.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
a) Added command-line I/O class for adding new items and creating new lists
    The current app had manual task entry and users wouldn't want to edit the
    code to add a task. The command-line becomes a simple front-end for that.
b) Allow for the deletion of multiple items
    Gets a command-separated ids for deleting multiple items
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
The user interface could be improved and data could also be persisted. I have also
intentionally didn't cover test cases since it is a learning project and not a
production application.
